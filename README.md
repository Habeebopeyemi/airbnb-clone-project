### 🔍 Importance of Identifying Design Properties in a Mockup

Identifying the design properties (such as colors, fonts, spacing, and element behavior) from a mockup is critical to accurately translating the designer's vision into functional code. It ensures:

- 🎯 **Consistency**: Developers maintain visual and functional consistency across all components.
- 🛠️ **Efficiency**: Reduces guesswork during implementation, saving time and effort.
- 🧩 **Scalability**: Makes it easier to reuse styles and components across multiple pages.
- 🤝 **Collaboration**: Bridges the communication gap between designers and developers by using a shared visual language.
- 📐 **Precision**: Delivers a pixel-perfect user interface that matches the intended user experience.

By identifying these design properties early, teams ensure a smooth transition from design to development, leading to better performance and user satisfaction.
